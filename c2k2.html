  <h3 class="study-header">Internet access is more important than ever</h3>
  <p class="body-p">
    We are all aware of how much more time we spent on the computer since the COVID-19 pandemic began. While a good chunk of our time was surely spent on leisure activities like gaming or watching Netflix, we also dedicated hours of our time on the computer to productive activities like attending school or getting work done. Clearly, having consistent access to a computer throughout the day is necessary for our livelihoods. Not having that access makes getting an education or earning an income significantly harder, and that is the exact challenge many low-income families face today. In 2020, 46% of adults with an income under $30,000 said they do not have access to a computer at home. This is a serious issue, and providing a way for low-income families to access the tools necessary to participate in remote work and learning is a priority.
  </p>
  <h3 class="body-subtitle">Problem Statement</h3>
  <p class="body-subtitle">
    With work and school becoming increasingly reliant on technology and remote connection, low-income families are in need of easier and less costly access to computers.
  </p>
  <p class="body-p">
    Nonprofit Computers2Kids helps solve this challenge by providing desktops and laptops to low-income families and individuals, but is lacking in its accessibility. As of right now, C2K has no dedicated way of applying for a computer on a mobile device, which is the primary way an individual would access the internet and find opportunities to solve their problem. C2K’s lack of a mobile system also hinders their ability to service new cities and regions, further limiting the scope of their mission.
  </p>
  <h3 class="study-header">How did C2K operate before?</h3>
  <p class="body-p">
    Until now, C2K has used a Google Form for families to apply for a computer through their phone.
  </p>
  <div class="shadow-lg p-3 mb-5 bg-body rounded">
  <img src="images/c2k/C2K Application.jpg" class="pdf mx-auto d-block overview" />
  </div>
  <p class="body-p">
    This presents a few problems that limit the amount of families C2K can reach:
  </p>
  <ul class="body-p">
    <li>Relies on C2K individually emailing or calling applicants with updates</li>
    <li>Hard for users to check the status of their application</li>
    <li>Users cannot easily get support on a computer C2K gave them</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="study-header">An app is the clear solution</h3>
  <p class="body-p">
    Having a dedicated mobile app would allow C2K to partially automate their process, requiring less resources to service more people.
  </p>
  <p class="body-p">
    Our team and C2K leadership agreed on three main goals to accomplish through the creation of a mobile app:
  </p>
  <ul class="body-p">
    <li>Streamline the application and client interface process</li>
    <li>Allow new users to apply to be a C2K client, new & existing users to request computers or tech support, and existing users to check their order statuses and adjust their information</li>
    <li>Achieve 20% or more existing Computers2Kids customers to use the app once it launches in the app store</li>
  </ul>

    Our initial ideas of the flow of the app and how we can transition smoothly from the old application.
  </p>
  <h3 class="study-header">Phrasing is key</h3>
  <p class="body-p">
    After creating initial mid-fidelity wireframes, we sought to poke holes in our designs through usability testing. We specifically had parents test the app since parents are the main stakeholders that will be applying for a computer.
  </p>
  <p class="body-p">
    The key issues raised through testing involved confusing language that may ward off a user from using a certain feature.
  </p>
  <p class="body-subtitle">
    Here were a few of our revelations:
  </p>
  <p class="body-p">
    If a service offered is free of charge, we need to clearly include text that says so.
Popups are necessary to confirm a user’s action, such as a confirmation message of a computer being added to the cart.
  </p>
  <img src="images/c2k/C2K-UsabilityChanges-MyOrders.jpg" class="mx-auto d-block overview" id="bigger" />
  <p class="body-p">
    We updated the mid-fi wireframes based on our user testing results to serve as the backbone of the high-fidelity designs.
  </p>
  <h3 class="study-header">The UI emphasizes Branding and Adaptability</h3>
  <p class="body-p">
    Before moving on to a hi-fidelity prototype, we needed to standardize UI elements such as colors and font. This offered a great opportunity to reinforce C2K’s established brand identity and to make coding the screens easy on the developers.
  </p>
  <div class="shadow-lg p-3 mb-5 bg-body rounded">
  <img src="images/c2k/Style Guide Revised.png" class="mx-auto d-block overview" id="bigger" />
  </div>
  <p class="body-p">
    C2K’s brand colors are blue and orange, both of which symbolize education and youth. This symbolism is important when discussing an organization that provides educational tools to families, so we wanted to keep those brand colors prominent and consistent in our design. In our initial explorations, we found that heavy use of orange was aesthetically unpleasing, especially when combined with white or black text. We decided to use a teal blue as the main color, with orange being used as an accent for punctuation.
  </p>
  <p class="body-p">
    Our choice in font was made with convenience in mind. We were on a tight 10-week schedule and we wanted to minimize extra work for the developers to do. To make coding the screens as frictionless as possible, we chose default fonts: Roboto for Android and SF Pro for iOS.
  </P>
  <p class="body-p">
    C2K asked us to prominently include “Cam,” a character used in their branding. Including Cam was a balancing act, as we wanted to include Cam but also make the app look sleek and professional. Like our use of orange, we decided on using Cam as an accent.
  </p>
  <p class="body-p">
    We included Cam in the onboarding, loading, and homepage buttons.
  </p>

  <h3 class="study-header">Design is heavily reliant on developer constraints</h3>
  <p class="body-p">
    The developer team was using React Native to build the app. While working on the hi-fi screens, we handed the updated mid-fi wireframes to them to begin building out. We mainly wanted feedback on which aspects of the designs needed to be changed before implementation so that we could incorporate those changes in the hi-fi designs.
  </p>
  <p class="body-p">
   A few of the components we designed were custom-made, and in our feedback sessions we learnt that some of these components are already built-in to React Native. We redesigned these components in our screens to be directly transferable to React Native.
  </p>
  <p class="body-p">
    As part of the process of making the development process seamless, we decided to create artifacts that would clearly lay out how we used certain UI elements. This was especially useful for colors:
  </p>
  <h3 class="study-header">Coming back to old plans</h3>
  <p class="body-p">
    Our first round of hi-fi designs capped off the Develop for Good winter cycle and set the stage for what we would work on during the spring cycle. With the core functionality already designed, we were able to return to old ideas that C2K wanted implemented, but we couldn’t design earlier due to time constraints.
  </p>
  <p class="body-p">
    A big feature C2K wanted us to implement was a donation feature that would allow individuals to support C2K’s efforts. We originally envisioned this feature as its own dedicated page in the navbar, with the “Order a computer” screen simply being reached through a button on the home page. In our first round of hi-fi designs, we removed “Support C2K” from the navbar and replaced it with a tab to go directly to the Order a Computer page.
  </p>
  <p class="body-p">
    When revisiting how to include a donation feature, we thought: why not use our original flow for the “Order a computer” feature? A button on the homepage is the most clearly visible spot for it, and placing it alongside the “Order a computer” and “Request tech support” buttons gives that feature a prominence and importance that will hopefully lead to more donations.
  </p>
